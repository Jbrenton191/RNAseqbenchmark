NOTE: It appears you are running salmon without the `--validateMappings` option.
Mapping validation can generally improve both the sensitivity and specificity of mapping,
with only a moderate increase in use of computational resources. 
Mapping validation is planned to become a default option (i.e. turned on by default) in
the next release of salmon.
Unless there is a specific reason to do this (e.g. testing on clean simulated data),
`--validateMappings` is generally recommended.

[2019-11-22 11:05:44.178] [jointLog] [info] Counted 185,487 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-11-22 11:05:44.186] [jointLog] [info] Number of fragments discarded because they have only dovetail (discordant) mappings : 65
[2019-11-22 11:05:44.186] [jointLog] [warning] Only 185487 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
