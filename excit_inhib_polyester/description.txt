Workflow-

1. Used inhibitory genes and excitatory genes from list instead of potassium and immunoglobulin genes, but had to update the symbols from the HGNC website-https://www.genenames.org/tools/multi-symbol-checker/
2. Changed the size parameter in polyester which seems to alter the spread of the data-increase or decrease the variance
3. Ran salmon and shuffling as normal
4. Ran the DESeq and EdgeR
5. Made some graphs from the DESeq analysis
